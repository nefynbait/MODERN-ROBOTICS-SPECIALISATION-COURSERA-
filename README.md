# MODERN-ROBOTICS-SPECIALISATION-COURSERA-
All the projects of modern robotics course

The Github repository consists of three folders PROJ 2.1, PROJ 3.1, PROJ 4.1 and CAPSTONE PROJECT.
•	PROJ 2.1 – Consists of MATLAB code which takes configuration of the end effector frame as input and provides a csv file as output which consists of joint angles for every iteration.
