# MODERN-ROBOTICS-SPECIALISATION-COURSERA-
All the projects of modern robotics course

The Github repository consists of three folders PROJ 2.1, PROJ 3.1, PROJ 4.1 and CAPSTONE PROJECT.
•	PROJ 2.1 – Consists of MATLAB code which takes configuration of the end effector frame as input and provides a csv file as output which consists of joint angles for every iteration.


•	PROJ 3.1 – Consists of MATLAB code which takes initial joint angles and external forces and provides csv file as ouput which consists of joint angle for each time steps.
•	PROJ 4.1-Consists of MATLAB which implements a naïve A*star algorithm.
•	CAPSTONE PROJECT- Consists of MATLAB code which simulates the motion of KUKA’s youBot
